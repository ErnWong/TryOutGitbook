# Book Example with a bit of maths

This is the first paragraph. Nice eh? All in markdown. Yeah! Awesome!

Now this is the second paragraph. I will introduce a bit of maths. Don't worry, just doing some addition like \\(x+y=2\\) or \\(x^2+3-\zeta=\text{I don't even}\\).

Phew, we survived that, or not, don't know yet till we try. What about display maths? If \\[x^2+y^2=\int_0^\infty \sqrt[5]{x}\,\mathrm{d}x\\] appears in a separate paragraph, or doesn't get displayed at all, then oh no. It should look like

\\[x^2+y^2=\int_0^\infty \sqrt[5]{x}\,\mathrm{d}x\\]
